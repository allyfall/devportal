            <p>Once upon a time, long ago, there was a girl living in a cottage in the woods. The cottage was lovely and warm in the winter, though the snow piled up against the sides and the wind howled. One dark and freezing night, during the worst storm the girl had ever seen, someone began pounding on her thick, oaken door.</p>

    </section>
    <div class="holdup">
            <p>The girl stood from her comfortable place by the fire to peer out of the window. Outside, the darkness was absolute and the wind was screaming. It was an inhospitable night. She sighed, knowing that she would never forgive herself from turning away a stranger that needed help.</p>
    </div>
    <section id="sect3" class="group">
      <div class="paraLayer base"></div>
      <div class="paraLayer charG"></div>
      <div class="paraLayer charW"></div>
      <div class="paraLayer FG"></div>
    </section>
    <div class="holdup">
            <p>She opened the door and, laying on her front stoop, shivering and cowering from the blizzard, was the wolf. The girl blinked, surprised, and slammed the door as quickly as she could. For a moment, she stood with her back pressed against the door, heart beating in her throat. Then, she paused. The wolf had frightened her when she was a child, but she was grown now. She knew better. The wolf came to her for a reason. What right had she to lock him out, to deny him aid when he was in need?</p>
    </div>
    <section id="sect4" class="group">
      <div class="paraLayer base"></div>
      <div class="paraLayer charG"></div>
      <div class="paraLayer charW"></div>
      <div class="paraLayer FG"></div>
    </section>
    <div class="holdup">
            <p>The young woman turned around and hesitantly pulled the thick door open again. The winter night rushed in, flurries of snow skittering across the snow. On her porch, the wolf laid nestled in a snowdrift, trembling. She moved aside, allowing him to enter the safety of her cottage, protected from the raging wind and mercyless winter. </p>
    </div>
    <section id="sect5" class="group">
      <div class="paraLayer base"></div>
      <div class="paraLayer charG"></div>
      <div class="paraLayer charW"></div>
      <div class="paraLayer FG"></div>
    </section>
    <div class="holdup">      
      <p>December crawled into January, and the young woman began to enjoy the wolf's presence. His ability to deter other preditors was much appriciated, and he drove away the loneliness that often plagued her in the winters—she liked to think the feeling was mutual. Once the blizzard was over, he was able to venture outdoors and hunt for himself. Sometimes, he would bring meat back to her, which she would smoke over the fire. The girl never regretted opening her door to the wolf when he was in need—their relationship bloomed, bringing diversity and light to her life.  </p>
