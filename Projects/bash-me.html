<h2>About Me</h2>
<p> I have lived in Colorado all my life and am a fairly stereotypically Coloradan. I enjoy the outdoors, especially skiing, hiking, and mountian biking.</p>
<p> This year, I am a junior with a double major in TAM and English, which is more useful than it sounds, I promise.</p>
<p> The coolest thing about me is that I race mountain bikes. Also, I have broken all my fingers, but that isn't actually cool</p>
